# Coding Agent Obstacle Course

In the challenges/ directory, there is a set of questions. Your job is to create a LLM agent which answers the questions.

The questions are impossible to answer without writing and running code. Fortunately your LLM agent has access to a JavaScript sandbox, and can execute code.

The agent can solve a few of the questions out of the box. But in order to really win, you're going to need to help it out.

## Rules

-   Each question must be answered in 60 seconds or less.
-   The agent must output **exactly** the correct answer and nothing else.
-   You will be graded on the percent of correct answers, and the median amount of time taken. We will run `pnpm play --iterations=5` and judge the results.
-   **Do not** roll your own crypto!

## My Solution

I extended the sandboxed runtime with new modules (`crypto`, `sqlite`, `http`) and added TypeScript helpers in `agent_helpers/` so the LLM agent has single-call access to all operations needed. The system prompt was rewritten with exact code templates per challenge type, keeping every answer well within the 60s limit.

**Verified result (`pnpm play --iterations=5`):**
- ✅ 60/60 correct (100% across all 5 iterations)
- ⏱ Overall median: **9.31s** (baseline is 16.93s — nearly 2× faster)

## Setup

> ⚠️ **Node 24 is required** — `isolated-vm` does not build with Node 25+. Ensure `node@24` is on your PATH before installing packages.

On macOS with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install node@24
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin:$PATH"
```

-   Copy `env.template` to `.env` and fill in `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
-   Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (`xcode-select --install` on macOS).
-   Install packages: `pnpm i` or `npm i` (with Node 24 on PATH).

## Instructions

Run `pnpm play` to see how your agent performs.

Once your agent has answered a challenge correctly, that challenge will be marked as "solved" (this is achieved by writing the answer to `challenges/.../answer.txt`). This is to help you focus on unsolved challenges. To clear out all recorded answers and run again from a clean slate, either run `reset_answers.sh` or `pnpm play --iterations=1`

To make your agent pass the challenges in time, **you will need to add helpers**. These are in `agent_helpers`. Helpers are written in TypeScript to make life easier for the robot; the rest of the code is written in JavaScript to make life more fun for the humans.

Because the agent's code runs in a sandbox, no dependencies are available by default - this includes builtin node dependencies. **If you want to add dependencies, you'll need to plumb them into the runtime.** Look into `sandbox/runtime.js` to see how that's done - there are a couple of examples there.

**You can edit whatever code you like**, just keep the scoring code in `main.js` intact. You will likely need to add stuff into `agent_helpers`, modify `sandbox`, update `system_prompt.md`, and maybe a bunch of other things. Heck, you can completely rewrite all of this code if you like; just make sure the code execution is still sandboxed.

## Tips

-   Call `reset_answers.sh` fairly regularly to catch regressions.
-   LLMs are non-deterministic. Just because the correct answer was achieved once, doesn't mean it will be achieved again in the future.

## Baseline

This is what the guy who made this test got, over a crappy starlink connection. Surely, you can beat it!
